These days, with rise in content in social media and other platforms with millions of views, 
companies are focusing on advertising on these new platforms for wide publicity, 
cheaper marketing options and targeted advertising. 
Thus this project is aimed at detecting brand logos in images and 
thumbnails of social media and other platform images and videos. 
This would determine the amount of publicity the brand receives, 
the sales revenue company could expect and identify the marketing cost per sale based on cost of advertising in contents. 
This would also help in comparing various advertising options and in determining the final price of the product based on advertising costs. 
This is also essential in determining budgets for next financial year.

I have done this project for 4 companies to show application of computer vision in local business (Priya and Pistahouse) 
and startup (Skippi and Beyondsnack of shark tank).

Since I was working alone on this project, I have executed it in Colab notebook instead of end to end application with api/UI. 
The custom dataset required for this project was collected from internet and annotated online.
yolov5s model was used.
